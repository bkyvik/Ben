1. 
	a. Gravitational Waves
	b. Cosmic Microwave Background
	c. Gravitational Lensing
	d. Higgs Boson
	e. Quantum Tunneling

2.
	a. Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC) contains hundreds of
	gravitational wave transients observed by LIGO
	b. Legacy Archive for Microwave Background Data Analysis (LAMBDA) is a NASA
	dataset that contains data from countless experiments and obersations of
	the Cosmic Microwave Background
	c. The CASTLES Survey is a dataset that contains over a hundred Multiply
	Imaged Systems whose appearance is distorted due to gravitational lensing 
3. Maybe I could use conditionals, loops, and dictionaries to sort through data in
the CASTLES dataset
4. I could try to make an interactive graph program that generates graphics for 
comparing different items in the dataset. Less ambitiously, I could make a "search
engine" in which users could filter through CASTLES items based on desired criteria
